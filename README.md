# Installation
I don't plan to release the app on the AppStore, currently, for the simple reason that I don't have an Apple Developer account. However, those with a mac, can easily open the project in Xcode and install it onto their devices.

If the demand is there, I will create an AltStore repository so users can easily install the app with AltStore.
